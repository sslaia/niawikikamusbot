Applying the new layout (revisi2) to the existing wiktionary entries

This script was created for implementing the decisision made by the Nias Wiki community on 7 Oct 2024 to improve the wiktionary entries by adding missing sections. With this implementation all pages have consistent layout and the order of the sections are predictable.

Previously each wiktionary contributor created his/her own layout and chose the sections to have and not in order.
